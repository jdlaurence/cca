# The MedGemma Impact Challenge

Build human-centered AI applications with **MedGemma** and other open models from Google’s **Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF)**.

---

## Overview

In this competition, you’ll use MedGemma and other open models from Google’s Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF) to build human-centered AI applications.

- **Start:** January 13, 2026  
- **Final Submission Deadline:** February 24, 2026  
- **Time Remaining:** 20 days to go

## Description

AI is already reshaping medicine, from diagnostics to drug discovery. However, many clinical environments cannot rely on large, closed models that require constant internet access or centralized infrastructure. They need adaptable, privacy-focused tools that can run wherever care is delivered.

To address this need, Google has released open-weight models specifically designed to help developers create novel healthcare and life sciences applications more efficiently. **MedGemma** and the rest of the **HAI-DEF** collection provide a strong foundation for building powerful tools while maintaining full control over models and infrastructure.

In this competition, you will use these models to build full-fledged demonstration applications. Whether your focus is workflow automation, patient communication, or diagnostics, your solution should demonstrate how these tools enhance healthcare.
